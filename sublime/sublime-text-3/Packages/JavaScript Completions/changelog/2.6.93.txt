v2.6.93

# Announcement

I'm implementing new features thanks to Flow (static type checker from Facebook).
With it I can implement other features and there will be a better autocomplete
(smart autocomplete based on the current context).

This is in Beta version and I published it on github (same repository but under another branch):
https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScript-Completions/tree/v3-beta

but I will move it on a new repository (so it will be a new plugin on Sublime Text)
because it will offer not only a better autocomplete but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run Cordova emulator, build, compile, serve Cordova projects, add plugins and platforms, etc … directly on Sublime Text!)
- Ionic projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Node.js projects
- Local bookmarks project
- Show javascript errors with Flow
- etc, etc …

It will be something like a JavaScript IDE on Sublime Text!

It isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!
I will let you know the moment I have any news!!

Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: pichillilorenzo@gmail.com

Thanks to all your support!!!

## Improvements

- Added support for automatic download for node.js and npm on Windows
