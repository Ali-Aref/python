v2.6.97


ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW PLUGIN "JavaScript Enhancements" RELEASED ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
=======================================================================

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ FINALLY ADDED SUPPORT ALSO FOR WINDOWS ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
=================================================

I developed a new plugin with new features thanks to Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook).

So, I will NO LONGER SUPPORT "JavaScript Completions" plugin, except in particular cases. 
I'm going to focus only on this new one!

You can find it on: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

This new plugin offers not only a better autocomplete but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular v1 and v2 projects
- React projects
- Express projects
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript real-time errors
- etc. (I will add also React Native and NativeScript support)

You could use it also in existing projects!! (see the Wiki - https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki)

It will turn Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!

## OS SUPPORTED NOW by this new plugin:
=======================================

ðŸ‘‰ Linux (64-bit)
ðŸ‘‰ Mac OS X 
ðŸ‘‰ Windows (64-bit): released without the use of TerminalView plugin. For each feature (like also creating a project) will be used the cmd.exe shell (so during the creation of a project don't close it until it finishes!). Unfortunately the TerminalView plugin supports only Linux-based OS ðŸ˜ž . Has someone any advice or idea about that? Is there something similar to the TerminalView plugin for Windows?? Thanks!

Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: pichillilorenzo@gmail.com

Thanks for your support!!!
