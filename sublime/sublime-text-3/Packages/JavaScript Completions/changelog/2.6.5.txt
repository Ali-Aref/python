  Thanks to @Fyrd.
  You can use this feature in HTML, CSS and JavaScript context!
  Just put the cursor on the word you want to check, "right-click" -> "Can I use?" and it will appear an input panel with all items that have a name matching with the word.
  You can use key-map: ctrl+alt+w. You can also change it. Just go to Preferences -> Package Settings ->  JavaScript Completions Tools -> Key Bindings - User.
  After selecting an item from the list, it will appear a popup with all information from the http://caniuse.com support tables.
