v2.6.8

# Announcement

I'm implementing new features thanks to Flow (static type checker from Facebook).
With it I can implement other features and there will be a better autocomplete
(smart autocomplete based on the current context).

This is in Beta version and I published it on github (under another branch):
https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScript-Completions/tree/v3-beta

But it isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!
I will let you know the moment I have any news!!

Thanks to all your support!!!

## Fixes

- fixed #13 issue (initial sublime text freezing)
- fixed #34 issue ((Not working) 'Create class from object literal')
- fixed #30 issue (Global autocompletions aren't loaded)
