## ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW PLUGIN "JavaScript Enhancements" DEVELOPMENT ##
=====================================================================

I'm developing a new plugin with new features thanks to Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook).

After its first release, I will NO LONGER SUPPORT "JavaScript Completions" plugin. I will focus only on this new one.

You can find it on: https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements

This new plugin will offer not only a better autocomplete but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular v1 and v2 projects
- React projects
- Express projects
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript real-time errors
- etc.

It will turn Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!

I'm going to release a first testable version these days, so WATCH the repository to stay tuned for any news!

## OS SUPPORTED now by this new plugin:
=======================================

- Linux (64-bit)
- Mac OS X 

Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: pichillilorenzo@gmail.com

Thanks for your support!!!
