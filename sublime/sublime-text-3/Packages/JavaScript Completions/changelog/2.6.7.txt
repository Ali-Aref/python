v2.6.7

# Announcement

I'm implementing new features thanks to Flow (static type checker from Facebook).
With it I can implement other features and there will be a better autocomplete.
This is in Beta version and I will public it on github (under another branch)
as soon as possible for testing purpose before I upload it on Package Control officially.
So I ask you to help me with testing when it will be on github.

However I apologize for the delay in replying to your request!
I'm just a person that is working on this plugin and I have been busy lately.
Thanks to all your support!

## Improvements

- "Javascript Completions Tools" menu moved under Tools
- Fix about "Can I use" feature (github: #31, #19)
- On Hover Description now works also in embedded html
- Fix for Context menus not showing in embedded html (github: #20) 
- Fix Standard JSDoc configuration file (github: #27)
- Now you can set node_js_custom_path and npm_custom_path variables 
  in Javascript Completions > Settings to use your installed version of "nodejs" and "npm"
  for all the features such as "Evaluate JavaScript"
  (This will not override the version installed locally by this plugin!!)
