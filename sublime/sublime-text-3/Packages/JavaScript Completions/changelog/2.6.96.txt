v2.6.96


ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW PLUGIN "JavaScript Enhancements" RELEASED ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
=======================================================================

I developed a new plugin with new features thanks to Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook).

So, I will NO LONGER SUPPORT "JavaScript Completions" plugin, except in particular cases. 
I'm going to focus only on this new one!

You can find it on: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

This new plugin offers not only a better autocomplete but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular v1 and v2 projects
- React projects
- Express projects
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript real-time errors
- etc.

You could use it also in existing projects!! (see the Wiki - https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki)

It will turn Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!

## OS SUPPORTED NOW by this new plugin:
=======================================

- Linux (64-bit)
- Mac OS X 

Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: pichillilorenzo@gmail.com

Thanks for your support!!!
