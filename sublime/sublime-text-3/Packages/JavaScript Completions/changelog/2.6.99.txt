ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW PLUGIN "JavaScript Enhancements" RELEASED ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
=======================================================================

I developed a new plugin with new features thanks to Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook).

So, I will NO LONGER SUPPORT "JavaScript Completions" plugin, except in particular cases. 
I'm going to focus only on this new one!

You can find it on: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ

This new plugin offers not only a BETTER AUTOCOMPLETE but a lot of FEATURES about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- JavaScript real-time errors
- Code Refactoring
- Local bookmarks project
- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 (it includes also v3) projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular v1 and v2 (it includes also v4 and v5) projects
- Vue projects (only about the creation at this moment)
- React projects (only about the creation at this moment)
- React Native projects (only about the creation at this moment. I will add also **NativeScript** support)
- Express projects (only about the creation at this moment)
- Yeoman generators
- etc.

You could use it also in existing projects!! 

SEE the Wiki - https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements/wiki
to get the complete list of the features that it offers!

It will turn Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!
=====================================================

## OS SUPPORTED NOW by this new plugin:
=======================================

ðŸ‘‰ Linux (64-bit)
ðŸ‘‰ Mac OS X 
ðŸ‘‰ Windows (64-bit)
