This document details the syntax. Left-aligned texts are considered headings.

/*
	Offset headings can be created by enclosing text in forward-slashes
	and asterisks
*/


Getting started
-	Create a task by adding a '-' in front of it
----	Add hyphens to change the color
	-----	5 looks urgent
	----	4 for important items
	---	3 for the middle
	--	2 for the pretty light stuff
	-	1 for the low-priority or easy stuff
-4	Alternatively, you can add a number after one hyphen
	-3	This starts with a `-3`
	-2	`-2` is the same `--`
	-1	etc...
	-	This is new in 1.0.5


Notes
-3	A task can have notes: by adding a ':' then add text
-3	Or by adding the notes under the task
	Like these notes. Notes can have `emphasis` by adding slanted quotes.


Sub-tasks
-4	A task can have sub-tasks
	-2	Sub tasks are indented
	-1	And they can have: notes - just like any task
		-3	Or 3rd level sub-tasks
			With notes underneath


Completed items have a '+'
+-2	This item is finished because it starts with a'+'
	-3	This sub-task is finished bc it's parent is
-2	Completion applies to sub-tasks
-3	Use the keys `cmd /` shortcut to toggle completion
	It's just like toggling a comment


State of emergency
!-3	Emergency / Disaster: This item is in a state of emergency.
	It's in the emergency state because of the `leading exclamation mark`.
	----	The emergency will apply to any sub-tasks
	--	Like these two
+!--	A completed emergency task
	This emergency item was handled.


Ignored tasks by adding a leading '.'
.--	This item is ignored because it starts with a `period`
----	Ignoring applies to sub-tasks
	.---	This sub-task is ignored
		---	This sub-sub-task is ignored bc its parent is
--	Include a reason for ignoring it
.----	(Reason for ignoring) Ignored items can have a note in parentheses
	so you can save a note indicating why it's being ignored


The symbol list
----	To skim current tasks
	use the `cmd r` shortcut to see an outline (notes are omited)


Hard-tabs at 8-width or 5-width
----	A hard-tab at 8-space width AFTER the '-'s
	`Why?`
		The task titles will always line up.
	`Why hard-tabs?`
		The alignment of the title won't re-adjust when you change
		the number of dashes, add an exclamation mark or plus-sign.
	`Why 8-space width?`
		8 is the right number because there is a max of 7 token characters
		that might precede the task-title. 7 because you can have up
		to `5` dashes + `1` exclamation mark + `1` plus-sign. Tabs
		that are `8` spaces wide allows there to always be at least one
		an extra space between the tokens and the task title:
	+!-----	A title here
	--	A title here
		^ `sweet alignment`

-4	Alternatively, Hard-tabs at 5-space width
	If the `-4` pattern is used then 5 characters allows for:
	-	`+` or `.`  token
	-	! token
	-	- token
	-	A number
	-	A final space to separate the title
	.!-4	(for example)
	-3	The default Tab Size can be changed via the menu option:
		-	Sublime Text
		-	Preferences
		-	Package Settings
		-	ToDone
		-	Settings - User
		-2	And adding the following to the file: `
			{
			    // The number of spaces a tab is considered equal to
			    "tab_size": 5
			}`


More expressive notes
---	If you need more complex notes: ///
	An `explicit note` is started by the `///` characters.
	An explicit note can have lines that start with a `-` or `+`.
	Explicit notes end when another `///` is encountered.
#	Whitespace is ignored
	- some simple notes
	- that aren't considered tasks
	- but are a list
	///
