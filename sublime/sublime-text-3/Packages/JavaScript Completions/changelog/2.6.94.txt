v2.6.94

# Announcement

I'm developing a new plugin with new features thanks to Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook).
With it I can implement other features and there will be a better autocomplete
(smart autocomplete based on the current context).

This is in Beta version and I published it on another github repository:

https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements


This new plugin will offer not only a better autocomplete but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run Cordova emulator, build, compile, serve Cordova projects, add plugins and available platforms, the ability to install local version of Cordova in the project, etc … directly on Sublime Text!)
- Ionic projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular projects
- Node.js projects
- Local bookmarks project
- Show javascript errors with Flow
- etc, etc …

It will turn Sublime Text into a JavaScript IDE like!

It isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!

WATCH the repository to stay tuned for any news!

Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: pichillilorenzo@gmail.com

Thanks to all your support!!!
